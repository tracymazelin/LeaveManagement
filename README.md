# LeaveManagement
A python flask web application utilizing the Bulma UI Framework with Postgresql and hosted on Heroku.  This application has been built for the Capstone project of my Masters in Software Development.  It allows employees to submit requests for time-off, managers to process the requests, and administrators to add employees and managers.
